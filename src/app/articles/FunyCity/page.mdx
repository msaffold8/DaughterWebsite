Guess what? I went to the Fun City Trampoline Park and it was AWESOME! I felt like a kangaroo bouncing everywhere!

When we got there, there were trampolines everywhere! Big ones, small ones, and some were even on the walls!

## Jumping Like a Superhero!

I jumped so high, like a superhero! It was like flying. One time, I jumped so high that I thought I could touch the sky. Bruno, my toy dog, was watching. I think he wanted to jump too.

There was this big foam pit, and I jumped into it. It was like landing on a fluffy cloud. I pretended I was diving into a sea of marshmallows.

## Racing and Dodgeball

They had races on the trampolines, and I raced with other kids. I was super fast and won two times! Then we played dodgeball on trampolines. It was tricky but so much fun. I was giggling the whole time.

Then we had yummy snacks. I had my favorite - cheese pizza! It tasted even better after all the jumping and playing.

I was really tired at the end, but it was the best day ever. I can't wait to go back to Fun City and jump some more!

Fun City is the best place ever for jumping and playing. If you like to bounce and have fun, you should go too! It's like a party every day there! ðŸŽ‰
