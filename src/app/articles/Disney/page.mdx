Yay! I went to Disney and it was AMAZING! It was like a big, big, big dreamland with lots of colors and fun!

First, we saw this HUGE castle. It was like the ones in my storybooks, but real! I told my daddy that I am a real princess now. I think he agreed.

## The Best Rides Ever!

Guess what? I went on rides that went round and round. My favorite was the teacups because I got to spin them super fast. Then, there was this ride with boats and singing dolls. They sang 'It's a Small World.' 

Oh! And I saw real princesses. They were so pretty and nice. I got a picture with Cinderella, and she said I looked like a princess too. That made me super happy!

## The Magic Parade and Sparkly Fireworks

The parade was like a big party! There were floats with all the Disney people. I saw Mickey and Minnie, and I waved at them super hard. Then at night, the sky was full of fireworks. They were like glitter popping in the sky. It was so pretty.

I can't wait to go to Disney again. It was the bestest day ever!

Disney is like a magic land where all the stories come true. I wish I could go there every day. It's my most favoritest place ever! ❤️
