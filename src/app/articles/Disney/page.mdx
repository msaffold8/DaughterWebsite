Yay! I went to Disney and it was AMAZING! It was like a big, big, big dreamland with lots of colors and fun!

First, we saw this HUGE castle. It was like the ones in my storybooks, but real! I told Bruno, my toy dog, that we were real princesses now. He barked, so I think he agreed.

## The Best Rides Ever!

Guess what? I went on rides that went round and round. My favorite was the teacups because I got to spin them super fast. And Bruno sat next to me! Then, there was this ride with boats and singing dolls. They sang 'It's a Small World.' It's still stuck in my head!

Oh! And I saw real princesses. They were so pretty and nice. I got a picture with Cinderella, and she said I looked like a princess too. That made me super happy!

## The Magic Parade and Sparkly Fireworks

The parade was like a big party! There were floats with all the Disney people. I saw Mickey and Minnie, and I waved at them super hard. Bruno tried to bark 'hello' too. Then at night, the sky was full of fireworks. They were like glitter popping in the sky. It was so pretty, I didn't want to blink!

I can't wait to go to Disney again. It was the bestest day ever with Bruno and my family!

Disney is like a magic land where all the stories come true. I wish I could go there every day. It's my most favoritest place ever! ❤️
